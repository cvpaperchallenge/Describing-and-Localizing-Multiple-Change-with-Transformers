# Multiple Change Captioning Dataset generation

- This code generates multiple change captioning dataset using Blender and is modified based on the CLEVR Engine proposed by Johnson *et al.* in their [CVPR 2017 paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/). Please refer to the [repository of CLEVR Engine](https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-dataset-gen) for the setup of Blender.

- You can generate your own multiple change captioning dataset using the code inside this directory.

## Install blender

- Before dataset generation, please install the [blender](https://www.blender.org/)

- Follow the steps described in [CLEVR]（https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-dataset-gen） for blender setup.
